    We also had a variety of moving options. which were:
    <ul>
        <li>Moving your items into your new residence. </li>
        <li>Moving your items from your current house into a "pod" </li>
        <li>Taking your items back to our warehouse where you will have to come get with your own crew and trucks. </li>
    
    </ul>
